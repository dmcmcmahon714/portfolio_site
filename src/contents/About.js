<p>I am a lifelong musician with a passion for technology’s role in the creative field. Troubleshooting and getting to the bottom of roadblocks to peoples’ artistry gives me a deep sense of satisfaction. While I have significant experience in a professional office setting performing customer-service oriented legal work, I have also been obsessed with creating digital music since I could first afford a computer. Additionally, my love of people and strict yoga & meditation practices have allowed me to help people realize their creative goals while maintaining a peaceful, even temper. I am currently developing my hard technology skills, so I can come to an even deeper understanding of these systems.
